# NX Motion Simulation - Friction with Tipping

I want to see what happens in the simulation when the applied force causes the object to tip over due to friction. This is gonna be fun 😁

Maximum force for the crate to remain in eqilibrium is 308.3 N so let's apply 400 N to make it tip over

# Result
The delay in contact actually being registered in the simulation is visible. As is the moment when our force P is fully applied and the edge of the crate is digging into the ground. And ofcourse the grand finale when the crate begins to tip over towards the end of the simulation and the force starts to decrease as the crate loses contact with the ground 😃
